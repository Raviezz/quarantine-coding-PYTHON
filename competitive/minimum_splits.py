> Minimum splits required to convert a number into prime segments
> Given a number in the form of a string s, the task is to calculate and display minimum splits
    required such that the segments formed are Prime or print Not Possible otherwise.

   Examples:
       1. Input: s = “2351”
          Output : 0
          Explanation: Given number is already prime.Input: s = “2351”

       2.  Input: s = “2352”
           Output: 2
            Explanation: Resultant prime segments are 23,5,2

        3.  Input: s = “2375672”
            Output : 2
            Explanation: Resultant prime segments are 2,37567,2
